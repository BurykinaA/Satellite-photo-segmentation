# Solution

Our solution is a model for the automatic identification of infrastructure objects from high-resolution satellite images. We have analyzed recent neural networks such as MAFF-HRnet, DeepMAO, and others. Based on our research, we have designed a final solution demonstrating high accuracy. Automatic segmentation of satellite images will enable scientists and specialists to improve the quality of research in the field of predicting natural disasters, analyzing various types of terrain, and further processing the obtained results. The solution is implemented in Python using a patch-based training method to train models, allowing for artificially increasing the size of the training dataset in conditions of a small set of high-quality image snapshots. The quality of the model and high accuracy are achieved through the modifications we have implemented in the input image processing.
